# Blight Prediction Capstone Project

This is my capstone project for the Data Science at Scale Specialization on Coursera. Given the combination of categorical and continuous data, I chose to use a random forest model which obtained descent results when taking into account the class imbalance. The challenge of this project seemed to be in choosing the features, which came from very messy data which needed to be extensively pre-processed. I leave this here as a demonstration of these cleaning methods.
